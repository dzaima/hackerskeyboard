## Overview ##

Are you missing the key layout you're used to from your computer when using an Android device? This software keyboard has separate number keys, punctuation in the usual places, and arrow keys. It is based on the AOSP Gingerbread soft keyboard, so it supports multitouch for the modifier keys.

This keyboard is especially useful if you use ConnectBot for SSH access. It provides working Tab/Ctrl/Esc keys, and the arrow keys are essential for devices such as the Xoom tablet or Nexus S that don't have a trackball or D-Pad.

The supported keyboard layouts include Armenian (Հայերեն), Arabic (العربية),
British (en\_GB), Bulgarian (български език), Czech (Čeština), Danish (dansk),
Carpalx English (language "en-CX"), Dvorak English (language "en-DV"), English
(QWERTY), Finnish (Suomi), French (Français, AZERTY), German (Deutsch, QWERTZ),
German Neo2 (Deutsch, language "de-NE"),
Greek (ελληνικά), Hebrew (עברית), Hungarian (Magyar), Italian (Italiano), Lao
(ພາສາລາວ), Norwegian (Norsk bokmål), Persian (فارسی), Portuguese (Português),
Romanian (Română), Russian (Русский), Russian phonetic (Русский, ru-rPH),
Serbian (Српски), Slovak (Slovenčina), Slovenian
(Slovenščina)/Bosnian/Croatian/Latin Serbian, Spanish (Español, Español
Latinoamérica), Swedish (Svenska), Tamil (தமிழ்), Thai (ไทย), Turkish (Türkçe),
and Ukrainian (українська мова).
